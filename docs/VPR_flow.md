# Programming a FABulous fabric with VPR

VPR (Versatile Place and Route) is a place and route tool from the VTR project that can be used to program a fabric generated by FABulous, using either Yosys or ODIN II for the logic synthesis. The VTR genfasm tool can then be used to generate a fasm file from which the bitstream can be generated.

To generate the necessary materials to program using VPR, run $FABulous\_root/fabric\_generator/fabric\_gen.py with the -genVPRModel flag. In the $FABulous\_root/fabric\_generator/vproutput directory, two files will be created - architecture.xml and routing\_resources.xml. architecture.xml contains a description of the various tiles, ports and BELs - everything in the architecture except for the routing resources. These routing resources are specified in the routing\_resources.xml file, which contains a graph within which the nodes are routing wires and ports, and the edges are the switch matrix interconnects that connect these resources.
