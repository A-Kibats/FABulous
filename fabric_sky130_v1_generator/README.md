Due to long wire antenna issue in Sky130 pdk, we insert buffers at the input and output port on long wire local routing. 
If you don't want the buffer insertion, you can use the ```fabric_gen_nobuf.py``` script instead.

The layout generation can be found at [eFPGA---RTL-to-GDS-with-SKY130](https://github.com/FPGA-Research-Manchester/eFPGA---RTL-to-GDS-with-SKY130).
